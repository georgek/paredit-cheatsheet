* Paredit Cheatsheet

** Overview

   Just a LaTeX/PDF version of the Paredit documentation in the form of a
   handy cheatsheet which you can stick on your wall while you're learning
   Paredit.

   "If you think paredit is not for you then you need to become the kind of
   person that paredit is for."
